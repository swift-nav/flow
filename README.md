Wolf is a wrapper around Amazon Simple Workflow Service: it providers a decider
that implements plans, an actor that runs commands, and a registrar that
installs plans. See [examples](examples).

## Getting started
1. Install [Haskell](haskell).
2. Install the Haskell package manager [stack](stack).
3. Setup your global environment:
    1. `mkdir ~/.local/bin` if it doesn't exist already.
    2. add `$HOME/.local/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.
        - This is usually in `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or similar.
4. Install build dependencies in the `wolf` stack:
    1. `stack install hlint shake-0.16.4 shakers happy`
5. Run `stack build`. It should install all dependencies, build binaries, and
   export those binaries to `~/.local/bin`.

Alternatively, read the `.travis.yaml` file.

## Docker getting started
1. Install [Docker](docker).
2. Ensure your AWS permissions are current: Docker will build from an
   intermediate image hosted on swiftnav's AWS ECR.
3. Run `docker build --rm -t wolf-dev .`

## Development

`wolf` has a shakefile/makefile to provide convience around building and testing:

    # build the project's libraries, executables, and tests
    $ ./Shakefile.hs build-tests-error
    
    # test the project
    $ ./Shakefile.hs tests-error
    
    # start an interpreter with the project's libraries, executables, and tests loaded
    $ ./Shakefile.hs ghci-tests
    
    # install the project's executables
    $ ./Shakefile.hs install
    
    # clean the project
    $ ./Shakefile.hs clean
    
    # lint the project source code
    $ ./Shakefile.hs lint
    
    # format the project source code
    $ ./Shakefile.hs format


## Dependencies

To build, install, run, and test `wolf`, the following (global) dependencies may
be required:

+ [stack][stack]
+ [lint][lint]
+ [shake][shake]
+ [shakers][shakers]

## Common build errors

### "Plan construction failed."
When building tests using `./Shakefile.hs build-tests-error`, the ambiguous
`Plan construction failed.` error may rear its head. Make sure your `gcc`
installation is clean (`brew doctor` may help), and make sure you've installed
`stack`, `shake`, and `shakers`. Essentially, what this error is telling you is
that either `shake` isn't installed, isn't available to the `./Shakefile.hs`, or
is otherwise broken.
